# kubeaddons-enterprise-tests

This repository hosts tests for the `github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-enterprise` repository. 


`mesosphere/kubeaddons-enterprise` is hosted as default catalog in many kubernetes clusters. The intention is to keep that repository clean of any overhead that might break the catalog integration.
